# Plataforma de Sustentabilidade - Fundo Verde

## Overview

The Fundo Verde platform is a comprehensive sustainability management system designed for companies to calculate their carbon footprint, invest in Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and track their environmental impact. The application serves as a bridge between carbon emissions calculation and sustainable investment opportunities in Angola.

**Current Status**: Production-ready with full keep-alive system implemented to prevent Replit hibernation on free tier.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```

└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, comprehensive API endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon Database (serverless), Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Custom session-based authentication with bcrypt
- **Build Tools**: Vite for frontend bundling, esbuild for backend compilation
- **Deployment**: Optimized for Replit hosting environment

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with modern React patterns and optimized for performance:

1. **Component Structure**:
   - UI components using shadcn/ui design system
   - Custom business logic components
   - Layout components (Navbar, Sidebar, Footer)
   - Specialized components (ProjectCard, OdsIcon)

2. **State Management**:
   - React Query for server state management
   - Custom hooks for business logic
   - Context API for authentication and onboarding
   - Global event system for real-time investment updates

3. **Routing**: 
   - Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
   - Protected routes for authenticated users
   - Role-based access control (Admin vs Company)

4. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - Global `investmentEvents` system for broadcasting investment value changes
   - Component subscription model for receiving real-time updates
   - Optimistic update pattern for immediate UI feedback
   - Graceful fallback to cached data when events are unavailable

### Backend Architecture

The Express.js backend provides a comprehensive API with:

1. **Authentication System**:
   - Custom session-based authentication
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Role-based access control (admin/company)

2. **Database Layer**:
   - Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
   - Connection pooling for optimal performance
   - Comprehensive schema with relationships

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Response compression
   - Static file caching
   - Database connection pooling
   - Preload cache for frequently accessed data

## Data Flow

### Carbon Footprint Calculation Flow

1. **Data Input**: Companies input consumption data (energy, fuel, water, waste)
2. **Calculation**: Backend calculates CO2 emissions using predefined factors
3. **Compensation**: System calculates required investment for carbon offset
4. **Investment**: Companies can invest in SDG projects to offset emissions
5. **Tracking**: Dashboard shows progress and impact metrics

### Investment Tracking Flow

1. **Project Selection**: Companies browse available SDG projects
2. **Investment Submission**: Upload payment proofs and investment details
3. **Admin Review**: Admin validates and approves investments
4. **Public Display**: Approved investments appear on public project pages
5. **Impact Metrics**: System tracks and displays collective impact

### Instant Investment Update System

The platform implements a sophisticated real-time update system for investment values:

1. **Global Event System**: Central `investmentEvents` module broadcasts value changes across components
2. **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately before server confirmation for instant feedback
3. **Component Subscription**: Project cards subscribe to investment events for their specific project ID
4. **State Management**: Local state (`currentInvestmentValue`) overrides cached values for real-time display
5. **Fallback Strategy**: System gracefully falls back to cached or default values if events fail
6. **Cache Invalidation**: Aggressive cache busting ensures eventual consistency with server state

This architecture eliminates delays in investment value updates, providing users with instant visual feedback when admin makes changes to project investment amounts.
